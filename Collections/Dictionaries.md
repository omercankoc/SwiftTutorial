# Dictionaries
A dictionary stores associations between keys of the same type and values of the same type in a collection with no defined ordering.
Each value is associated with a unique key, which acts as an identifier for that value within the dictionary. 
Unlike items in an array, items in a dictionary donâ€™t have a specified order. 
You use a dictionary when you need to look up values based on their identifier, in much the same way that a real-world dictionary 
is used to look up the definition for a particular word.
