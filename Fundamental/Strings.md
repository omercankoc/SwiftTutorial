# String
A string is a series of characters, such as "hello, world" or "albatross". Swift strings are represented by the String type. The contents of a String can be accessed in various ways, including as a collection of Character values.

Swift’s String and Character types provide a fast, Unicode-compliant way to work with text in your code. The syntax for string creation and manipulation is lightweight and readable, with a string literal syntax that’s similar to C. String concatenation is as simple as combining two strings with the + operator, and string mutability is managed by choosing between a constant or a variable, just like any other value in Swift. You can also use strings to insert constants, variables, literals, and expressions into longer strings, in a process known as string interpolation. This makes it easy to create custom string values for display, storage, and printing.

Despite this simplicity of syntax, Swift’s String type is a fast, modern string implementation. Every string is composed of encoding-independent Unicode characters, and provides support for accessing those characters in various Unicode representations.

- Definition a String
``` swift
var language : String
```
- Initialize a String
``` swift
var language = "Swift"
```
- Definition and Initialize a String
``` swift
var language : String = "Swift"
```
- Initialization with String Class
``` swift
var language = String("Swift")
```
- Definition and Initialize with String Class
``` swift
var language : String = String("Swift")
```
-  Initialize Multiline String Literals
``` swift
var language = """
    Swift Programming Languages
    By Apple
"""
```
-  Definition and Initialize Multiline String Literals
``` swift
var language : String = """
    Swift Programming Languages
    By Apple
"""
```
- Nullability Control
```swift
var language : String? = nil
if(language != nil){
    print(language!)
} else {
    print("NIL")
}
```
- Show each character in the string
```swift
for character in language {
    print(character)
}
```

```swift
var language : String = "Swift"
language.append(" Programming Language")
```

language.insert(".", at: language.endIndex)
```
```

var language = "Swift Programming Language"
var text: Set<Character> = ["S","P","L"]

language.removeAll(where: { text.contains($0) })

var message = "I came now!"
var replacedMessage = message.replacingOccurrences(of: "came",with: "go")
```
```

var message : String = "I am Swift Developer"

var hasPrefix = message.hasPrefix("I")
print(hasPrefix)
```

var message : String = "I am Swift Developer"

var hasSuffix = message.hasSuffix("r")
print(hasSuffix)
```
```
true
```
