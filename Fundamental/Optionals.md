## Optionals
In Swift, if a variable has no value, it must be declared as optional in order for it to have a value of "nil". 
If a variable can take a null value, that variable is optional.

### Definition Optional Variable
```swift
var value : String? = nil
```

### Implicit Unwrapping
The optional variable will take absolute value.
```swift
value!.uppercased()
```
If the variable is not assigned any value while we are using the variable, our application will give a runtime error and crash.
