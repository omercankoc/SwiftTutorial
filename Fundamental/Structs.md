# Struct
- Structs work as Value Types.
- They are kept in the memory with the stack logic, so when the data is wanted to be read, it is read faster.
- There is no inheritance feature in the struct. (No Inheritance)
- It cannot be used with Objective-C.
- They are simple and fast.
- They do not cause memory (RAM) problems.
- They are Threadsafe.
### Let's define a Struct
```swift
struct Language {
    var name : String
    var country : String
    var family : String
}
```
