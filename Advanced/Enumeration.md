# Enumeration
An enumeration defines a common type for a group of related values and enables you to work with those values in a type-safe way within your code.

Enumerations in Swift are first-class types in their own right. 
They adopt many features traditionally supported only by classes, such as computed properties to provide additional information about the enumerationâ€™s current value, 
and instance methods to provide functionality related to the values the enumeration represents. 
Enumerations can also define initializers to provide an initial case value; can be extended to expand their functionality beyond their original implementation; and 
can conform to protocols to provide standard functionality.
```swift
enum LanguageType {
    case Scripting
    case Compiled
}
```

- Adding an enum as a property to a class:
```swift
class Languages { 
    var language : String
    var developer : String
    var year : Int
    var type : LanguageType
    
    init(initLanguage : String, initDeveloper : String, initYear : Int, initType : LanguageType) {
        self.language = initLanguage
        self.developer = initDeveloper
        self.year = initYear
        self.type = initType
        
        print("Created Language Object!")
    }
}
```
```swift
let kotlin = Languages(initLanguage: "Kotlin", initDeveloper: "JetBrains", initYear: 2014, initType: .Compiled)
```
