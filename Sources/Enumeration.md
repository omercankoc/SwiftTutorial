## Enumeration
An enumeration defines a common type for a group of related values and enables you to work with those values in a type-safe way within your code.

Enumerations in Swift are first-class types in their own right. 
They adopt many features traditionally supported only by classes, such as computed properties to provide additional information about the enumerationâ€™s current value, 
and instance methods to provide functionality related to the values the enumeration represents. 
Enumerations can also define initializers to provide an initial case value; can be extended to expand their functionality beyond their original implementation; and 
can conform to protocols to provide standard functionality.

- Declaration
```swift
enum LanguageType {
    case Scripting
    case Compiled
}
```

- Enum in Model Classes
```swift
class Language {
    var language : String
    var developer : String
    var year : Int
    var type : LanguageType
    
    init(language : String, developer : String, year : Int, type : LanguageType) {
        self.language = language
        self.developer = developer
        self.year = year
        self.type = type
        
        print("Created Language Object!")
    }
}
```

- Instance
```swift
var swift = Language(language: "Swift", developer: "Apple", year: 2014, type: .Compiled)
print(swift.language, swift.developer, swift.year, swift.type)
```
```
Created Language Object!
Swift Apple 2014 Compiled
```
